# Gladius Node (Golang version)

The full suite of binaries for running a Gladius Node

## Development
### Dependencies
To test and build the gladius binaries you need go, glide and the make on your machine.

- Install [go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Install [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide)
- *Mac Users:* Install xcode for make `xcode-select --install`
- *Windows Users:* Install [Linux Subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

### Build 
To build all binaries for your current os and architecture simply execute `make`.
After the build process you will find all binaries in *./build/*.

#### Build specific binary
The Makefile can build single binaries too.
```shell
# build only the cli
make cli

# build the network daemon
make networkd

# build the control daemon (not implemented yet)
make controld
```

#### Build for a different platform
To build for a different platform specify toe GOOS and GOARCH variable.
```shell
# build for windows 64bit
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 make

# build for linux 32bit
GOOS=linux GOARCH=386 make
```


## Usage
### Run the binaries as a process
Run the executable created by the above step with `gladius-<executable-name>`

###Â Run networkd or controld as a service
You can also install networkd and controld as a service.
*Attention:* The service implementation is not tested.
```shell
# install networkd as a service
gladius-networkd install

# start the networkd service
gladius-networkd start

# stop the networkd service
gladius-networkd stop
```

### CLI
TODO

### Network Daemon

#### Test the RPC server (Only Start and Stop work now)
```bash
$ HDR1='Content-type: application/json'
$ HDR2='Accept: application/json'

$ MSG='{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "GladiusEdge.Start", "id": 1}'
$ curl -H $HDR1 -H $HDR2 -d $MSG http://localhost:5000/rpc
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"Started server","id":1}

$ MSG='{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "GladiusEdge.Stop", "id": 1}'
$ curl -H $HDR1 -H $HDR2 -d $MSG http://localhost:5000/rpc
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"Stopped server","id":1}

$ MSG='{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "GladiusEdge.Status", "id": 1}'
$ curl -H $HDR1 -H $HDR2 -d $MSG http://localhost:5000/rpc
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"Not implemented","id":1}
```

#### Set up content delivery

Right now files are loaded from `~/.config/gladius/gladius-networkd/` and take
the format of `example.com.json`. This functionality only works on linux right
now, and serving is not backwards compatible with the previous release. Content
can then be accessed at `http://<host>:8080/content?website=example.com`

## Some benchmarks compared to the previous version
Done over a gigabit link between two machines with the same bundle file being
served.

As you can see above, the Go version handles high concurrent request loads
significantly better than the Node.js version of the network daemon. The Go
version also saturates the Gigabit link, which likely means it can provide even
more performance.
